## AntennaSimResults


***A notch was found at 25 MHz in the 100 MHz solution frequency result, here we seek to identify the reason by applying a different solution frequency, which in turn affects the mesh size of interior objects.
***Difference to previous results: HFSS simulation of beam at 25 MHz was solved using a solution frequency of 50 MHz (not 100 MHz as was done previously).
